A package for BEAST2 implementing SNAPP

Documentation: http://beast2.org/snapp/

To compile from source, 
1. check out BEAST from https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2
2. check out SNAPP from https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/SNAPP in the same same directory (so that beast2/../SNAPP/../beast2/ == beast2/)
3. run ant from the snap directory containing this file.
